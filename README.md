This project is about building a basic Indonesia's minimum wage rates website. It consist of a main index page which displays the minimum wage rates based on user's pick of provinces in a form of a table or a map. The main objective is to practice using JavaScript concepts for retrieving and printing hardcoded or API data.

## Data Source

The minimum wage rates data is from Statistics Indonesia's [WebAPI BPS](https://webapi.bps.go.id/developer/) and [website](https://www.bps.go.id/indicator/19/220/1/upah-minimum-regional-propinsi.html).
