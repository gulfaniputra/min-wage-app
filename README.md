## About

> This project is part of The Udin Project (a collection of [@gulfaniputra](https://github.com/gulfaniputra/) personal projects).

This project is about building a basic Indonesia's minimum wage rates website. It consist of a main index page which displays the minimum wage rates based on user's pick of provinces. The main objective is to practice using JavaScript concepts to retrieve and print data.

The topics that is applied includes:

- HTML:

  - `select` element:

    ```
    <select id="">
      <option value="">first option</option>
      <option value="">second option</option>
      <option value="">third option</option>
    </select>
    ```

  - `input` element: `<input id="" type="" value="">`

- JavaScript:

  - basic JSON file structure and format:

    ```
    [
      {"firstProperty":"Value A", "secondProperty":"Value B"}
    ]
    ```

  - `click` event, `getElementById()` method, and `innerHTML` property:

    ```
    someId.onclick = function () {
      document.getElementById("").innerHTML = "Hello, world!";
    };
    ```
